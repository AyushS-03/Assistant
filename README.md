# Voice-Controlled Digital Assistant

This project is a simple voice-controlled digital assistant implemented in Python. It allows users to interact with their computer using voice commands to perform tasks such as opening applications like Notepad or Calculator.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to recognize voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provides feedback to the user through speech using the `pyttsx3` library.
- **Basic Commands**: Supports basic commands such as opening Notepad and Calculator.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (`speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-controlled-digital-assistant.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script:

   ```bash
   python main.py

2. Once the assistant starts, it will greet you and listen for your voice commands. Speak clearly and wait for recognition.

3. You can say commands like:
   - "Open Notepad"
